# LaporPinjol

I am responsible entirely for the back-end and some of the front-end development of this website. Most of the front-end development are done by my teammate (Jethro). The UI/UX design are done by another teammate of mine (Bedria). The images on this website are done entirely by my teammate (Bedria).

This website are developed using .NET 6.0 on Visual Studio 2022.

I am using Microsoft's documentation, YouTube videos, and Stackoverflow's answers to develop this website.
